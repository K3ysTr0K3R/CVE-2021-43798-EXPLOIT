# CVE-2021-43798 - Grafana Directory Traversal 🔍

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Versions 8.0.0-beta1 through 8.3.0 (except for patched versions) are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing unauthorized access to local files. This vulnerability does not affect Grafana Cloud. The vulnerability exists in the handling of the URL path `<grafana_host_url>/public/plugins//`. By manipulating the `<plugin_id>` parameter, an attacker can traverse directories and access files outside the intended directory.

## Impact 💥

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive files on the host system, potentially leading to further compromise of the Grafana instance or the host system itself.

## Affected Versions ❗️

## Recommended Actions 🔒

Users are strongly advised to upgrade their Grafana installations to one of the following patched versions:
